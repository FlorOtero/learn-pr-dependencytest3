    In the **Create App Service** dialog box, you will provide the following information:

    - **App Name**: This is the name of your application.  This will determine the URL of the published application, which will be https://<AppName>.azurewebsites.net.  It must be a unique value. Therefore, you will have to try out some different names to find one that is not reserved.

    - **Subscription**: The Azure subscription you wish to deploy the app to. Choose **Concierge Subscription**, which we provide to you through the sandbox.

    - **Resource Group:** Select the existing <rgn>[sandbox resource group name]</rgn> resource group.

    - **Hosting Plan:** The hosting plan specifies the location, size, and features of the web server farm that hosts your app. You can select an existing hosting plan or create one. For this exercise, you will create one.

        Click the **New...** button next to the hosting plan.
